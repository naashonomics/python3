#Use your knowledge of the re module and Python to create a function which takes a string as an input, searches that string for a pattern matching the pattern of a 9 digit zip code (eg 11111-1111) and prints anything that matches that pattern.
#Call your function with the text 
#"The zip code is 98210-1138." as its input.
